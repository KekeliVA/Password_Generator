# Password_Generator

The purpose of this assignment is to develop a password generator that adheres to the following criteria. 

* When button is clicked a password is generated
* Series of prompts for password criteria
* Select criteria for password
* Choose length of password between 8-128 characters
* Prompt user to select character types to include in password
* Provide the option of lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
* Validate the user input 
* When prompts are answered a password is generated that follows the user's specified criteria
* Password is generated and displayed on webpage

I took a slightly different approach and decided to employ the use of checkboxes in my code. The use of checkboxes I believed brought a cleaner look and better user experience to the webpage.
